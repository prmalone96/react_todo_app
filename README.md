Wasn't able to upload all of my files because there were too many
Since I started this project on my local machine and it's a react app,
I'm not sure how to upload all the pieces to Git to make it easily usable,
especially since I'd have to worry about passwords and whatnot. Overall,
the point of this is to show I've been working on react code and I know the
fundamentals. If you need a react developer, I may not be the best, but I'm
a fast learner and I know enough to get the job done.
